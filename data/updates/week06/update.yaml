**WEEK SUMMARY**

This week we added more usability to our [website page](https://altruismus.herokuapp.com/). We conducted a second interview session
with 5 volunteers and 2 organizations - Splash and the Debating society. From those interviews, we gathered some data (that
is presented below) that we found useful in making our website better and more user-friendly. We refined the home page and deleted 
some buttons based on user interviews. We shortened the blurb to make it more straigthforward and easy to read - also another
measured step taken after conducting user interviews. We also added an "add event" form for organizations to create events. Users and
organizations can now sign up/login, but we're having some slight issues with authentication.


**WEBSITE ADDITIONS**

Here's what the organization's [http://altruismus.herokuapp.com/oview) now looks like - we added the edit event/delete buttons 
(albeit without any functionality yet). The add event button works and takes you to a form for creating events. 


**NEXT STEPS**

* Working on getting a (non-static) main page for both volunteers and organizations - although this is the bulk of what 
our app consists of, and will probably span for more than a week at least
* Accessing info from the database and displaying select info on the page
* Getting more feedback from organizations
* Getting signups from volunteers and organizations
