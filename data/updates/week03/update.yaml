**WEEK SUMMARY**

More! More! More! This week we reached out to more organizations. We succeeded in getting the HTML5up template up! We also created 
slides to fake our app and allow our customers to experience the app and give us feedback. More details below. 

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Get a basic app landing page up that can allow volunteers and organizations to sign up for more updates about our app by
entering their email IDs. The landing page will give a basic explanantion about what our app means for volunteers and organizations
* Reach out to 5 more organizations- not everyone responds but hopefully get a few to sign up and gather more metrics from these
organizations
* Interview 5 more potential volunteers with a different background, especially people who already frequently volunteer, people who
are associated with Dwight Hall as volunteers and a few non freshmen undergraduates.
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP after spring break ends

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**
**We met a lot of the goals considering we were on spring break and no one was on campus!** 

* We did get the HTML 5up template to work and beautified our app. We separately also worked on the database and code for signing 

* We sent out emails to five more organizations we thought would be interested and easy to get in touch with: Family Science Night, 
New Haven RAMP and AIDS Walk New Haven. Two of the three organizations have responded. 

1. **Family Science Night:** We were able to [interview Melanie Bauer] 
(https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/document/d/1Cl-a69P3EN6yCAqYgJdLme1Sm4pDGURjxKYKPNnPrx0/edit?usp=sharing) from 
Family Science Night. She was extremely enthusiastic about our app as she wanted to basically find new places she could advertise 
for volunteers. 
> Our main findings from this interview were: Organizations have a pre-existing way through which they gather volunteer info eg. Google docs
> *Problem: * These organizations may not be willing to change their pre-existing method
> *Solution:* Make our app so easy to use that they will switch to our app becaise of convenience.
> *How to do this:* Show them our easy interface by faking the app

2. **New Haven RAMP:** Elena Hodges from New Haven RAMP responded to our email saying that she is very interested in our app. However, she was leaving for spring
break early and will meet us the first week after spring break ends

3. **AIDS Walk New Haven:** No response till now

* We interviewed four more volunteers in addition to the three from last week. Here's the link to our key findings from [volunteer interviews]
(https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/spreadsheets/d/1WNyZfFFEZH-xD805z2NSI_SCNjjpoluTZVZ_tOJrxQo/edit?usp=sharing)

* This is where we struggled the most. Firstly, we feel like this is something we could figure out together, atleast the initial steps until we 
get familiar with building the app, but are finding it extremely hard to do different parts alone as we can't meet up due to spring break and 
midterms earlier in the week. We couldn't figure out how to integrate the HTML 5 UP template we had chosen with heroku as it kept crashing.
We do have an extremely basic link with our app domain up on the web. Our app will potentially be called [Altruismus] 
(https://altruismus.herokuapp.com/).

* We had a long discussion about the various components of our app and sketched out how we envision the app would look like so 
we can start building it and so that we know what we will show as the "fake" version of our app by potentially using slideshow.
> * We discussed how can we minimize the amount of information we need from [volunteers] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtTVpYRmxxUlNQNWM/view?usp=sharing) and [volunteer organizations] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtcVNXVzVLQ3M2Qk0/view?usp=sharing) during sign up
> * We discussed whether we want different pages for organizations v/s volunteers on our [landing page] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtbk1UQWFueXlSaHc/view?usp=sharing). We agreed on having two different pages
to increase custmer satisfaction, clickability and ease of access of information, but still plan on having a very similar layout for both
in accordance with week 00's basic [app flow] (https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/presentation/d/1mwYujraCcggeLGaNWVQ_kNMYbZuifWWy-QUICtsX9YQ/htmlpresent)
and week 00's solution to reduce our work despite a two sided market.
> * We also figured out what all indormation organizations would like to be able to add for putting up [new events] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtMHlhQ1ZyLWxTb0k/view?usp=sharing). We added several new features 
we hadn't thought of before based on our talk and observation with Family Science Night such as ability to ask additional 
questions (such as in the case of FSN if volunteers needed transportation), as well as the type of volunteers they were
looking foe (such as FSN prefers undergraduates and above, especially with a science background)

* Anthony from Dwight Hall recently got back to us saying that he still thinks that "our app is a great idea."
He has talked to other Dwight Hall staff and the Outreach coordinator will get in touch with us soon.

**NEXT STEPS**
* Get a basic app landing page up that can allow volunteers and organizations to sign uo for more updates about our app by
entering their email IDs. The landing page will give a basic explanantion about what our app means for volunteers and organizations
* Reach out to 5 more organizations- not everyone responds but hopefully get a few to sign up and gather more metrics from these
organizations
* Interview 5 more potential volunteers with a different background, especially people who already frequently volunteer, people who
are associated with Dwight Hall as volunteers and a few non freshmen undergraduates.
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP after spring break ends
