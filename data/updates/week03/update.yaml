**WEEK SUMMARY**

More! More! More! This week we reached out to more organizations. We succeeded in getting the HTML5up template up! We also created 
slides to fake our app and allow our customers to experience the app and give us feedback. More details below. 

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Get a basic app landing page up that can allow volunteers and organizations to sign up for more updates about our app by
entering their email IDs. The landing page will give a basic explanantion about what our app means for volunteers and organizations
* Reach out to 5 more organizations- not everyone responds but hopefully get a few to sign up and gather more metrics from these
organizations
* Interview 5 more potential volunteers with a different background, especially people who already frequently volunteer, people who
are associated with Dwight Hall as volunteers and a few non freshmen undergraduates.
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP after spring break ends

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**
**We met a lot of the goals considering we were on spring break and no one was on campus!** 

* We did get the HTML 5up template to work and beautified our app [Altruismus](https://altruismus.herokuapp.com/). 
We separately also worked on the database and 
code for signing up, assuming the user already has an account. We didn't put it up on the app yet as we are still
working on allowing the user to sign up/ make an account but the here is a link to the 
[sign in code.](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/document/d/1TbZyuyysq8k8TsvAb4NuokK7DwzErCaHiEaHc2NyFk8/edit?usp=sharing)
We read up on SQLite, MySQL and Mongo DB, ultimately opting to use MySQL given its integration into the Cloud 9 platform. 
Then we applied the model/view/controller model to the login issue, creating an HTML file for the structure of the entry field, 
which must be linked to a JavaScript based controller for calling the text from the entry field and writing to the DB, and a 
link to the model (MySQL DB) via a PHP file, and CSS file to describe the view of the login.

* We sent out emails to five more organizations we thought would be interested and easy to get in touch with: Rock to Rock,
Point-in-Time Count organized by CCEH, Yale's Sustainable Program, DESK and Sunrise Cafe. Three of the five organizations have
responded, but we are hopeful that more will respond (at least Yale affiliated ones), once spring break ends (next week). 

> 1. **Rock To Rock:** We were able to [interview Anna Pickett](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/document/d/18B5qEZmh3wcqXDvhTzGfyb5mLr3T4eTXvdrxtk69KqE/edit?usp=sharing) 
from one of the Rock to ROck. She was interested in our app as she was interested in another platform, perhaps one
that is less complicated than their current website for advertising.
> Our main findings from this interview were: This re-confirmed what we found out from Family Science Night's 
interview from week02 - i.e. organizations have a pre-existing way through which they gather volunteer info, in 
this case a website.
> *Problem: * These organizations may not be willing to change their pre-existing method  
> *Solution:* Make our app so easy to use that they will switch to our app becaise of convenience.
> *How to do this:* Show them our easy interface by faking the app

> 2. **Yale Sustainable Food Project:** Sarah Gross , the Volunteer Coordinator responded to our email saying that 
she is very interested in our app and will be willing to discuss with us on how they can work with our app. We 
will setup a meeting with her soon.

> 3. **Sunrise Cafe:** Ellen Gabrielle responded and seems to be confused about what we are looking for. We will
clarify and possibly interview her soon.

> 4. **DESK:** No response yet

> 5. **Point to Point Count:** No response yet

* We weren't able to interview any new volunteers as nobody was on campus.

* We have set up a time to interview Elena from New Haven RAMP this week. We will also show her the slides during the meeting so that we can get input about the feel of the app.


**APP MOCK UP**
The photos below show a mock up of the app's homepage (somehow unable to embed images that aren't on the web :( ):

**NEXT STEPS**
* Write the code for signing up for our app so that we can bridge the difference between  the current template 
and the sign in code mentioned above.
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP this next week.
* Interview Sarah from Yale Sustainable Food Program once spring break ends.
* Interview 5 more potential volunteers with a different background, especially people who already frequently 
volunteer, people who are associated with Dwight Hall as volunteers and a few non freshmen undergraduates.
* Showing/testing our fake application to potential users - both volunteers and organizations, but will probably 
reach out to volunteers first
