title: Fixing Up Our Old Mistakes and Making New Ones
summary: |
  Refined our MVP specs! Worked on the app flow, gathering metrics from our markets, clarifying other 
  existing solutions and fixed up the blog with the proper repo this time (hopefully).

**WEEK SUMMARY**

This week we fixed up our repo problems from last week. We interviewed [Dwight Hall](http://dwighthall.org/about-us/history) – Yale's university-affiliated, independent, 
service organization, which is recognized as the central hub for service and the umbrella society
over a few smaller volunteering organizations such as Hunger Heroes and programmes like Freshman in Service. We also
interviewed five volunteers. Here's the [link](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/document/d/1lz_oKjJjHj_Wnny8nYyf8AYaDF8gKIe_G2sMW44YZRg/edit?usp=sharing) to our key findings from the organizations and 
volunteers. 

**ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM WEEK 00**

*Two Sided Market*
  * Even though there seems to be different requirements for the two markets- labor providers and labor seekers, 
  we can have a very similar layout and interface for both of these sides and thus, manage and reduce our work
  ![App Flow](https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/presentation/d/1mwYujraCcggeLGaNWVQ_kNMYbZuifWWy-QUICtsX9YQ/htmlpresent)

*Existing Solutions*
  * **Based on our volunteer side interviews**, volunteers usually use email lists, posters and organizations they are already familiar 
  with to look for more opportunities.
  * **Based on our volunteering organizations side interviews**, they usually use targetted emailing lists, facebook groups to 
  advertise any volunteering opportunities
  * **Based on our research**, there are a few existing applications such as VolunteerMatch that provides a list of volunteering
  opportunities based on preferences or GiveGab that combines social media and volunteering. Some others are [listed here](http://www.npo.io/25-volunteer-apps-everyone-needs/)

*How we are different*
  * No application seems to be providing the opportunity to volunteers to donate as well as volunteer but we plan on adding
  that functionality to enhance user experience
  * We plan on having a simpler interface than other applications
  * Even though there seems to be a few available applications for volunteering opportunities, both organizations and
  volunteers that we interviewed don't know about their existence and haven't used them. However, when we told them about our 
  idea, they were more than enthusiastic about using such an app. The executive committee president from Dwight Hall has even 
  expressed interest in collaborating or partenering with us. We plan on advertising it well and making our application the 
  primary platform through which the organizations get volunteers

*More focussed initial user base*
  * Geography: New Haven, especially the Yale community or Yale based community organizations
  * Age: College students and recent graduates 
  * Type of volunteering opportunities: Short commitment with none or very few pre requisites required from volunteers

Who is our customer or customers?

  * Millennials
  * Students in college 
  * Students just out of college
  * Middle-aged people in a full-time job with or without children
  * Middle schools

What is their *pain*?
  * Time constraint to perform community service (to do research etc.)
  * Lack of knowledge 
  * Not a lot of options
  
What kind of software do you think will solve their pain?
  * Taking the geolocation and schedule of each user and compiling a list of options for them
  * Being able to see reviews from previous volunteers 

How do you know these things?
  * Personal experience of wanting to do service but being unable to find the time to research  

How will you reach these customers and convert them into users of your app?
  * College community organizations
  * Service blogs
  * Facebook groups 
  * Middle school groups 

Could this potentially be used by millions of people? Why do you think so?
 * **Yes**! Think of Yelp, but for volunteer organizations.

 * In other words, people are realizing that service and selflessness is a component to happiness
 * Our theory is that the main thing stopping people from doing service work is inconvenience 

How do you imagine that you would support this venture? Is it non-profit? Is it for profit?

Our initial plan was to make it a for-profit venture – we planned on charging a small monthly fee, 
a minimum amount of $1.99 for supporting the app, and anything above $1.99 will 
go towards an organization. However after our discussion with Dwight Hall and interviewing some volutneers,
we are leaning towards making this non-profit, but we will still have constant reminders about the available 
opportunity to donate easily.

What are the biggest risks? 
  * Lack of operating costs
  * Premature scale, growing too fast
  * People aren’t willing to pay (the app does not solve the problem/this is not even a problem)
  * Even with the app people are not going to volunteer
  * The team didnt have the right knowledge base to build the startup correctly 

Now that you know the biggest risks, how could you most swiftly allay your fears about them? 
  * By conducting interviews and asking questions like – will customers be willing to pay, do they volunteer, 
   if they don’t volunteer, why? Would this app increase their likeliness to volunteer? 
  * By faking the app to test theories
  * We have google and Kyle and TAs and magic 

How can we maximize impact and what do we need to build?
  * Getting as many organizations and users registered
  * Push notifications are an annoying blessing
  * Implementation in public schools - make this an app teachers use to organize class volunteer trips

How will software function?
* Log in, provide details (location, time)
* A menu with categories to tell you what kind of service is available near you tailored to your schedule
* Link to [App Flow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h5IqYhZj4FYO1WDjzfskKUFrHW9TA6ftUbsgRlJfKC4/edit#slide=id.p4)

Describe the application architecture and technical choices needed to build that software. 
> How is it divided between client and server? 
  * We will use the MVC model (JavaScript for both client and server side)
  
> How do they communicate? 
  * Client interacts with the view layer, which as described above may incluse logging in, selecting categories
  and entering . These interactions are communicated through the controller which updates the model. On the other hand,
  when a model object is changed, the controller is notified which in turn updates the view.

> How are you storing data? 
  * SQL
  
> How will you manage, test, and deploy your code?
  * We will use a shared repository on cloud 9 to manage and collaborate on the code. 
  * We will deploy our code using Heroku 
  
> What technology stack are you going to use?
  * GitHub is god, GitHub is life
  
> How is our software designed? How do the pieces fit together?
  * Geolocation of user and destination are pull via java command from html framework styled in css. 
  Javascript is used to write to or pull content from a SQL database (fat model). The SQL database provides existing data 
  on the service opportunities (ID, location, time) and is joined with client inputs to produce the overlapping recommendation.
  The SQL database will include information about User ID, geolocations, service type preference, service types and volunteer 
  organizations IDs
