**WEEK SUMMARY**
This week we refined the [website page](https://altruismus.herokuapp.com/) somemore - added a short blurb that summarizes what our app
does, as well as an about page for organizations and volunteers respectively. We also added in a static page with a basic layout of what
the main page will look like, once the user (on the organization side) has logged in. We  finally settled on MLab and connected up 
our database for the signup and login pages. We also drated a new set of questions to ask volunteers based off what we have 
currently solidified on our app. During office hours, we pseudocoded/scribbled/drew on the whiteboard our next steps to take 
coding-wise, with the help of a TA. 

This week during class, we also made our first pitch. The link to the slides will be put down below, as well as what we thought 
we could improve on for our final pitch.

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Going to office hours to get help on the database.
* Getting a substantial website ready to show to organizations and volunteers and touch base again with the previous organizations 
and volunteers that we made contact with (priority is on organizations) to set up a meeting with them to preview the website

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**
* We went to office hours and solved a few problems we would probably have taken hours to solve on our own. We also came up with a 
loose idea of what our next steps would be
* Although we do have a database connected, we didn't get it up and running in time to test out with organizations or volunteers

**WEBSITE ADDITIONS**
Here's what the organization's [main page](http://altruismus.herokuapp.com/userview.ejs) will look like.

**FUTURE STEPS**
Here are [photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9W3zJ0nsnEHM2hLUkYtNDRySWs?usp=sharing) that we took during office hour of our next steps to take, code-wise.
