**WEEK SUMMARY**

This week we reached out to several more organizations and interviewed five volunteers. We also discussed our app flow in more detail, decided 
what template to use and searched long and hard for a name for the web application, whose domain wasn't already taken. We have started working
on putting up a basic landing page, but due to no web development experience before, we are facing quite a few hurdles. More details below.

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Deciding whether our application will be for profit or non profit.
* Contacting more volunteer service organizations, interviewing them and getting them interested in signing up.
* Interview more volunteers so that we can start consolidating more data
* Getting a basic landing page up
* Deciding how we ultimately want our various pages to look like.
* Making sure Dwight Hall is still interested as we didn't hear back from Anthony, the executive committee president for a few days

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**
**Yes, we met most of the goals!** This was a tough week in terms of midterms and especially spring break but we accomplished the following:

* We decided to go with **non-profit**! Based on our discussions with volunteer organization leaders like Anthony (from Dwight Hall) and 
Melanie Bauer (from Family Science Night), we  inferred that it would be best to be a non-profit as this whole community of volunteer service
is about giving and it wouldn't be a great idea to make a profit out of it. Moreover, we discussed this with Kyle and he also thought it would
be a good idea. Based on our interviews, we also realized that most volunteers and organizations aren't interested in paying for the app, beyond
perhaps a minor fee for signing up.

* We sent out emails to three more organizations we thought would be interested and easy to get in touch with: Family Science Night, 
New Haven RAMP and AIDS Walk New Haven. Two of the three organizations have responded. 

1. **Family Science Night:** We were able to [interview Melanie Bauer] 
(https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/document/d/1Cl-a69P3EN6yCAqYgJdLme1Sm4pDGURjxKYKPNnPrx0/edit?usp=sharing) from 
Family Science Night. She was extremely enthusiastic about our app as she wanted to basically find new places she could advertise 
for volunteers. 
> Our main findings from this interview were: Organizations have a pre-existing way through which they gather volunteer info eg. Google docs
> *Problem: * These organizations may not be willing to change their pre-existing method
> *Solution:* Make our app so easy to use that they will switch to our app becaise of convenience.
> *How to do this:* Show them our easy interface by faking the app

2. **New Haven RAMP:** Elena Hodges from New Haven RAMP responded to our email saying that she is very interested in our app. However, she was leaving for spring
break early and will meet us the first week after spring break ends

3. **AIDS Walk New Haven:** No response till now

* We interviewed four more volunteers in addition to the three from last week. Here's the link to our key findings from [volunteer interviews]
(https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/spreadsheets/d/1WNyZfFFEZH-xD805z2NSI_SCNjjpoluTZVZ_tOJrxQo/edit?usp=sharing)

* This is where we struggled the most. Firstly, we feel like this is something we could figure out together, atleast the initial steps until we 
get familiar with building the app, but are finding it extremely hard to do different parts alone as we can't meet up due to spring break and 
midterms earlier in the week. We couldn't figure out how to integrate the HTML 5 UP template we had chosen with heroku as it kept crashing.
We do have an extremely basic link with our app domain up on the web. Our app will potentially be called [Altruismus] 
(https://altruismus.herokuapp.com/).

* We had a long discussion about the various components of our app and sketched out how we envision the app would look like so 
we can start building it and so that we know what we will show as the "fake" version of our app by potentially using slideshow.
> * We discussed how can we minimize the amount of information we need from [volunteers] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtTVpYRmxxUlNQNWM/view?usp=sharing) and [volunteer organizations] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtcVNXVzVLQ3M2Qk0/view?usp=sharing) during sign up
> * We discussed whether we want different pages for organizations v/s volunteers on our [landing page] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtbk1UQWFueXlSaHc/view?usp=sharing). We agreed on having two different pages
to increase custmer satisfaction, clickability and ease of access of information, but still plan on having a very similar layout for both
in accordance with week 00's basic [app flow] (https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/presentation/d/1mwYujraCcggeLGaNWVQ_kNMYbZuifWWy-QUICtsX9YQ/htmlpresent)
and week 00's solution to reduce our work despite a two sided market.
> * We also figured out what all indormation organizations would like to be able to add for putting up [new events] 
(https://drive.google.com/a/yale.edu/file/d/0B3qHVNyc7ZFtMHlhQ1ZyLWxTb0k/view?usp=sharing). We added several new features 
we hadn't thought of before based on our talk and observation with Family Science Night such as ability to ask additional 
questions (such as in the case of FSN if volunteers needed transportation), as well as the type of volunteers they were
looking foe (such as FSN prefers undergraduates and above, especially with a science background)

* Anthony from Dwight Hall recently got back to us saying that he still thinks that "our app is a great idea."
He has talked to other Dwight Hall staff and the Outreach coordinator will get in touch with us soon.

**NEXT STEPS**
* Get a basic app landing page up that can allow volunteers and organizations to sign uo for more updates about our app by
entering their email IDs. The landing page will give a basic explanantion about what our app means for volunteers and organizations
* Reach out to 5 more organizations- not everyone responds but hopefully get a few to sign up and gather more metrics from these
organizations
* Interview 5 more potential volunteers with a different background, especially people who already frequently volunteer, people who
are associated with Dwight Hall as volunteers and a few non freshmen undergraduates.
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP after spring break ends
