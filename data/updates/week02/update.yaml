**WEEK SUMMARY**

This week we reached out to several more organizations and interviewed five volunteers. We also discussed our app flow in more detail, decided 
what template to use and searched long and hard for a name for the web application, whose domain wasn't already taken. We have started working
on putting up a basic landing page, but due to no web development experience before, we are facing quite a few hurdles. More details below.

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Deciding whether our application will be for profit or non profit.
* Contacting more volunteer service organizations, interviewing them and getting them interested in signing up.
* Interview more volunteers so that we can start consolidating more data
* Getting a basic landing page up
* Refinig app flow
* Deciding how we ultimately want our various pages to look like.
* Making sure Dwight Hall is still interested as we didn't hear back from Anthony, the executive committee president for a few days

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**
**Yes, we met most of the goals!** This was a tough week in terms of midterms and especially spring break but we accomplished the following:
* We decided to go with **non-profit**! Based on our discussions with volunteer organization leaders like Anthony (from Dwight Hall) and 
Melanie Bauer (from Family Science Night), we inferred that it would be best to be a non-profit as this whole community of volunteer service
is about giving and it wouldn't be a great idea to make a profit out of it. Moreover, we discussed this with Kyle and he also thought it would
be a good idea. Based on our interviews, we also realized that most volunteers and organizations aren't interested in paying for the app, beyond
perhaps a minor fee for signing up.
* We sent out emails to three more organizations we thought would be interested and easy to get in touch with: Family Science Night, 
New Haven RAMP and AIDS Walk New Haven.
