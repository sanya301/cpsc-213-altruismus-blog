**WEEK SUMMARY**

This week we cleaned up our website page - no more Latin nonsense and made it more user-friendly and appealing. 
We also we worked on the sign-up pages for both volunteers and organizations. We coded separately to try 
and incorporate a database – thank god for github and branches, because it was a disaster (that hopefully 
office hours/more googling will fix). We reached out to another organization on meeting up. 

**GOALS FROM LAST WEEK**
* Get a basic app landing page up that can allow volunteers and organizations to sign uo for more updates 
about our app by entering their email IDs. The landing page will give a basic explanantion about what our app 
means for volunteers and organizations
* Reach out to 5 more organizations and volunteers 
* Interview Elena from New Haven RAMP and Sarah from Yale Sustainable Food Program 
* Show/test our fake application to potential users - both volunteers and organizations, will probably 
reach out to volunteers first

**DID WE MEET THESE GOALS?**

* We managed to put up the sign-up pages for volunteers and organizations, and coded out a basic structure
 for what data we needed to collect from them, but we did not manage to get the database working. We also
 clarified, beautified and cleaned up our landing page. For example, we chose the colour orange for 
 our header because  
>"Orange is known to generate positive feelings and can be a great choice for the colour
> of your CTA" 
> The Ultimate Guide To Conversion Centered Design (the Unbounce reading, on 
> Conversion centered design). 

* We reached out to one more organization, and will be setting up a meeting with them in the near future,
however we decided that right now to focus more on coding & getting somethign tangible up since we're 
already collected a signinficant amount of data

* We have postponed the meeting with Elena (New Haven RAMP) and Sarah (Yale Sustainable Food Program), and
are waiting till we have a substantial website to show them - to potentially get them to create 
an account for their organization when we have the meeting with them. 

**UPCOMING PITCH**

* Jonathan made slides in preparation for this week's pitch in class that can be viewed 
[here](http://saamjo.herokuapp.com/updates/week04)

**NEXT STEPS**
* Going to office hours to get help on the database.
* Getting a substantial website ready to show to organizations and volunteers
* Touch base again with the previous organizations and volunteers that we made contact with (priority is on
organizations) to set up a meeting with them to preview the website
* Work on a lower fidelity mockup that shows the app's workflow. Will probably use basalmiq as suggested.
